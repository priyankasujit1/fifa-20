FIFA
FIFA, also known as FIFA Football or FIFA Soccer, is a series of association football video games or football simulator, released annually by Electronic Arts under the EA Sports label. Football video games such as Sensible Soccer, Kick Off and Match Day had been developed since the late 1980s and already competitive in the games market when EA Sports announced a football game as the next addition to their EA Sports label. The Guardian called the series "the slickest, most polished and by far the most popular football game around.

As of 2011, the FIFA franchise has been localised into 18 languages and available in 51 countries.
Listed in Guinness World Records as the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world, by 2018, the FIFA series had sold over 260 million copies.
It is also one of the best-selling video game franchises.

K-Means Clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs
to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.
It is popular for cluster analysis in data mining. k-means clustering minimizes within-cluster variances (squared Euclidean distances), but not regular Euclidean distances, 
which would be the more difficult Weber problem: the mean optimizes squared errors, whereas only the geometric median minimizes Euclidean distances. 
For instance, Better Euclidean solutions can be found using k-medians and k-medoids.





hierarchical clustering (also called hierarchical cluster analysis or HCA) is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters.

Strategies for hierarchical clustering generally fall into two types:

Agglomerative: This is a “bottom-up” approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.
Divisive: This is a “top-down” approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.
In general, the merges and splits are determined in a greedy manner. The results of hierarchical clustering[2] are usually presented in a dendrogram.
